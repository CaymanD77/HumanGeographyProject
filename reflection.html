    <h1>Reflection on The Rise of Smart Cities</h1>

    <p>Starting this project, I had a general understanding of what smart cities were. 
        I thought of smart cities as technologically advanced places that followed traditional city development 
        guidelines and later made upgrades. While I assumed these cities were designed/upgraded to improve overall city life, 
        I hadn’t considered how often they failed or the challenges they faced. I have never really viewed smart cities as particularly 
        positive or negative; I have always thought of them as a cool concept that could sometimes make life easier. 
        In my mind, smart cities were like flashy tech upgrades rather than major shifts in a city’s functions.</p>

    <p>While choosing a project topic, I knew I wanted something that combined both geography and technology. 
        As a computer science major, I obviously am more naturally drawn to tech-related subjects. I thought that 
        incorporating some tech into my project would make it more engaging for me, and allow me to construct something that I am proud of. 
        I also knew I wanted to present my research in a way that felt connected to computer science, which is why I eventually 
        decided to create a GitHub repository and use GitHub Pages for my final presentation.</p>

    <p>When I first found and began reading Cowley and Caprotti’s article, I quickly realized that it focused heavily on 
        issues with smart city development. I was surprised to learn that smart cities often lack organization and long-term planning. 
        Cowley and Caprotti showed that many of these smart cities are like experiments, with projects given to various organizations 
        instead of following a central plan. This was quite eye-opening. I hadn’t considered the potential downsides, such as increased 
        social inequality, before. After finishing the article, I decided to look for a second source that could offer potential solutions 
        to the problems Cowley and Caprotti described, as I thought that this comparison could make an interesting point for my project.</p>

    <p>That’s when I came across Stéphane Roche’s article. Roche’s work presented the idea that spatial enablement, 
        using geographic data to make cities more efficient, could be key to improving smart city success. His focus on citizen 
        engagement and geospatial infrastructure helped me see how smart cities can overcome the issues discussed in the first article. 
        After reading both texts, my view of smart cities shifted. I no longer see them as purely positive advancements. Instead, I now 
        believe smart cities can have a massive positive impact if designed correctly, but they can also worsen inequalities and create 
        long-term issues if executed in the wrong ways.</p>

    <p>I chose to build my project as a GitHub repository mainly because of my background in computer science. While GitHub is typically 
        used as a tool to help store and manage code coming from multiple people, I thought it would be interesting to use it as a way to 
        store a display a geography-based project. Using GitHub Pages allowed me to create a simple website that presents my research in a 
        clear and organized way, which I thought was cool and interesting to play with.</p>

    <p>Throughout the process, I really enjoyed working on the interactive map. While I’ve worked with code before, I had never used tools 
        such as Leaflet.js or integrated data points in this way before. Figuring out how to organize the information and link the points 
        to my research was a fun challenge. Putting together the map itself wasn’t extremely difficult, but I learned a lot through trial 
        and error. Seeing the final map work properly felt rewarding, and I feel like it added a unique and interactive element to my 
        project.</p>

    <p>The construction of and research for this project has helped me to learn some very interesting and previously unknown information 
        about smart cities. At first, I assumed smart cities were fairly straightforward, small upgrades within cities that improved 
        daily life. Now, I see that they’re far more complex and unpredictable. While smart cities can bring huge benefits like better 
        transportation, energy efficiency, and improved services, the projects often fall through due to being poorly planned. 
        These projects falling through can introduce new issues within these communities, or make existing issues worse. 
        I still don’t feel strongly that smart cities are either entirely good or bad; instead, I think their success comes down to how 
        well they’re designed and whether they truly address the needs of the people living there.</p>

    <p>This project helped me to better understand the role of <strong>geography</strong> in understanding smart cities. 
        Both articles displayed how geographic data can play a crucial role in city planning and organization. 
        Geography influences everything from how transportation networks are built to how environmental factors are managed in cities. 
        By exploring the geographic side of smart cities, I feel like I have gained a better appreciation and understanding of 
        spatial data and physical space can affect innovation in these urban environments.
