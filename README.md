# The Rise of Smart Cities

## Introduction
My project works to explore the concept of **smart cities**, with a focus on both the **challenges** they face and potential **solutions** for overcoming those challenges. By analyzing two key academic articles, this project is designed to highlight potential risks in smart city development and propose potential strategies to improve smart city success.

The project is structured in two layers:
1. **Issues with Smart Cities** — Based on Robert Cowley and Federico Caprotti’s article, *Smart City as Anti-Planning in the UK*  
2. **Solutions for Smart Cities** — Based on Stéphane Roche’s article, *Why Does a Smart City Need to Be Spatially Enabled?*

## Why Use GitHub for This Project?
I chose to build this project as a **GitHub repository** because GitHub is commonly used by **computer scientists** to organize, store, and present technical projects. As a computer scientist, I only use GitHub for coding projects and wondered what it would look/be like to use it for a project that has essentially nothing to do with code. By hosting my **GitHub repository** as a **GitHub Pages website**, I’m able to display my research in a more visual and accessible format. This makes it easier to explore the work without having to download files or navigate confusing file systems.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- **Anti-Planning:** Explored by Cowley & Caprotti, this concept critiques the experimental nature of smart city development, which risks creating disorganized and ineffective urban strategies.
- **Spatial Enablement:** Discussed by Roche, this concept emphasizes the need for geographic data to help improve decision-making, empower citizens, and guide urban development.

By combining these two ideas, this project works to present an understanding of smart cities — both the **challenges** they may face and potential **solutions** that can improve their success.
